We construct modular, human-readable, composable CFF models of four popular, deployed DeFi protocols in Ethereum: Uniswap, Uniswap V2, Sushiswap, and MakerDAO, representing a combined 24 billion USD in value as of March 2022. We use these models along with some other common models such as flash loans, airdrops and voting to show experimentally that CFF is practical and can drive useful, data-based EV-based insights from real world transaction activity. Without any explicitly programmed attack strategies, CFF uncovers on average an expected $56 million of EV per month in the recent past.</span><br><br>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04347'	'https://boards.4channel.org/biz/thread/55072436#p55073340'	'2023-05-24T19:59:40.569453400'
