Even if you"'re giving the wages of the off shore contractors all to the quality control guy instead, there will still be a huge time and effort save as producers will no longer need to scramble to contract out the grunt work of animating. Sooner rather than later the technology will improve to the point that there will no longer be a separate in-betweener role. Handling the in-betweening will be a standard function of the animator"'s software and the job of quality checking will fall to them. <br>The end result being that even if the budget for wages remains the same, the time, effort, and number of people needed to produce an anime will be reduced, resulting in savings from the peripheral improvements. They can either pocket the savings or give staff raises without actually increasing costs, and the money will be kept local. All while the people screwed over by the change live in another country. <br>Ideally the time and consistency improvements will allow for improved animation as well.
